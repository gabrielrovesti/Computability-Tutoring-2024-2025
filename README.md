## üìÅ Repository Structure

For each meeting, accompanied with date, there is the notes file being written by me during the lesson (tablet-based) and the PDF transcription of the same notes, so to help you use directly this one in case of misunderstandings and also to have a more coherent form.

I do specify that for each meeting there is a folder called "Useful files", which can be used as summary to study for exams or just to personally get a better grasp of the presented lesson's content.
It's all present there to help: material there is also found within the web (owners are specified), given this is material found easily within search engine searches (or custom created so to help you).

### Subfolders present

- **"General course notations"**
    - Helps to read and understand the notation of the course and of each meeting of the tutoring activities presented
    - Includes documents on functions, minimization, Cantor's method, SMN Theorem, predicates, recursive sets, Rice's theorem and Rice-Shapiro Theorem

- **"Exercises with no solutions"** 
    - Helps you in seeing all of the solutions for exercises from the professor PDF currently with no official solutions plus some exercises from older exams with the same logic
    - It's intended to be a guidance and a draft, so in case of errors or doubts, feel free to feedback

- **"General guides"** 
    - Notes written specifically for each exercise category
    - Includes guides on recursive functions, proving non-computability, Rice's theorem, S-m-n Theorem, universal functions, predicates, and more

- **"Meetings - Tutorings"**
    - Contains all tutoring sessions organized by date
    - Each meeting folder includes:
      - Lesson notes (tablet-written .xopp)
      - PDF transcription 
      - PC-written notes in both .docx and PDF formats
      - "Useful files" subfolder with topic-specific materials

- **"Notes"**
    - My notes file - complete of everything - written last year for this course and updated on some peers suggestions (always welcome!)
